## Description
In an unexpected turn of events, you happen to cross paths with a stray cat on your way home. Upon bringing the cat home, it is up to you to nurture and care for your new furry companion. Through mini games such as finding your catto or collect kibble to feed your fur baby, you can show your commitment as a new cat owner to bridge the emotional space between you and your feline friend~

Over the course of the weekend, most members were learning Unity for the first time. This project was most of your first hand at game development and our first game jam as a collective. 

For the most part, the mouse left click allows you to interact with different elements in the game and the left and right arrows are used for the kibble game.

Some sound effects and background music were free, open-source assets.
